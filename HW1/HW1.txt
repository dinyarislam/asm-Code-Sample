One interesting Fact about myself:
I hold the record for being the youngest Karate black belt holder in my country, Bangladesh. I officially became a 1st degree black belt holder on March 25th 2011 at the age of 9 years 11 months and 7 days, four years after I first started taking karate lessons, and made it on the local news.

Method I'm using to run Linux/Unix:
Mac OS terminal
